                Teddy grew up in New York City with a loving family and a love for nature as he would hike and adventure

                fighting against the evil of monopolies, and
                the majority of the republican party, as the majority of the republican party was for
                corporations. To destroy his career
                William Mckinley chose him to become his vice president. Ironically Mckinley was shot and Teddy became
                the president and began his highly progressive reforms.

                  was appointed to Secretary of War in 1907. Soon after, Roosevelt realized that Taft would be
                  the best suit for president. He was swiftly nominated by the Republican Convention and got the
                  presidency.

                    Pres. Wilson fought for women's rights, Batman displays women's rights by fighting for everyone
                    equally,
                    equal rights equal fights. Wilson also fought for child labor laws and batman generously donates to
                    orphanages and adopts. Although Wilson was extremely racist, to the
                    point of watching "The Birth of a Nation" thankfully Batman isn't racist but his flaw is that he
                    trusts
                    no one which can lead him to get a bad reputation.
